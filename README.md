# Rust Guess Game

> Quite unique game, where you have to guess the number between different ranges. The game will give you hints if the number is too high or too low.

This project is a part of the Rust learning process that I am currently doing. So there are some imperfections and not the best practices used in the project.

## What is inside?
- 🔹 Terminal UI (TUI) (`📦 ratatui`)
- 🔹 Leaderboard in json file (`📦 serde` and `📦 serde_json`)
- 🔹 Random number generation (`📦 rand`)
- 🔹 Colored output (`📦 colored`)
- 🔹 Dates and time (`📦 chrono`)
- 🔹 User input handling
- 🔹 Game logic
- 🔹 Files and folders separation (mods)

## How to run and play?
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo run` in the terminal
3. Try to win 🧐

## Code quality
Since this project is a part of the learning process, I tried to make the code as clean as possible. However, it may be (and it is) far from perfect. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
